## Abstract:

In this study, the application of an autonomous fire extinguishing robot with a fuzzy controller approach was carried out. For this purpose, an autonomous robot which can provide motion is designed and reaching the target and controlling the position were aimed. The embedded system (Atmega2560) was used on the designed autonomous robot. Flame Sensor, Li-po battery, L298 Motor drive, DC motor, servo motor, digital compass sensor are used on this system. Robot is processing the position and route information through a fuzzy controller. As a result of the data obtained, flames created in the environment are detected by robot through the patrol and then the robot extinguishes the flames with its impeller and continues its patrol. As a result, the autonomous robot detects the flames considered as target point during the patrol task and the fuzzy controller is used to determine the distance to be taken and the direction with the digital compass.
